1
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,053
Our world, their world...

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,121
it is a Pokémon world,

3
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,054
filled with the most amazing
creatures imaginable.

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,956
They fill the oceans,
thrive in the mountains,

5
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,756
soar high over the horizons,

6
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,457
and share the sparkling
landscapes of cities.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,067
Try and count them if you dare.

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,328
But then, try and count
the grains of sand

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,165
on your favorite beach.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,638
Mankind and Pokémon alike
have long journeyed together

11
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,644
to experience the thrill and
challenge of the Pokémon battle,

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,840
living and learning together
as teammates...

13
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,714
sometimes opponents, yes,
but ever friends.

14
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,887
Yet there are those

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,718
who blindly take advantage
of a Pokémon's trust

16
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,884
to further their own selfish,
egotistical ambitions

17
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,189
in the name of darkness.

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,696
But as the pendulum swings
both ways,

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,063
there are the Pokémon Rangers
as well,

20
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,500
whose job it is
to protect Pokémon

21
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,868
and protect nature,

22
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,306
reflecting the balance
that is nature.

23
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,379
Which also happens to hold
within its protecting arms

24
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:24,210
a young man we know
as Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town,

25
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,409
who, along with his beloved
Pikachu,

26
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,554
has set his sights
on nothing less

27
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,746
than becoming a Pokémon master,

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,360
sharing his dreams with some
equally dedicated friends,

29
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,987
a microcosm of the vast world
of Pokémon and people together,

30
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,125
experiencing the sorts of things
one might expect... or not.

31
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,362
But living their dreams
nonetheless,

32
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,564
for this is part of the journey.

33
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,038
This is the journey.

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,008
And the world of Pokémon
is about to present our heroes

35
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,272
with a new role, a shift,

36
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,145
a journey until now for them,
unimagined.

37
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,102
- Corsol.
- Corsol.

38
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,873
- Corsol.
- Corsol.

39
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,538
- Corsol.
- Corsol.

40
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,048
- Corsol.
- Corsol.

41
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,455
Clam!

42
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,682
Cloyster.

43
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,489
Ooh!

44
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,863
Horsea!

45
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,342
Tam!

46
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,674
Manta!

47
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,124
I have target confirmation.

48
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,023
Currently riding the tide
and heading southeast.

49
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,432
Distance to target... 50.

50
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,664
40.

51
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,035
30.

52
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,370
Recover now!

53
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,841
Roger.

54
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,971
Recover now!

55
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,844
Now! Now!

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,132
Recovery complete.

57
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,970
Surfacing to retrieve
helicopter.

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,338
- Galen!
- Huh?

59
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,245
Remember, there are two types
of men in this world...

60
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,411
those who have unlimited desires
and those who do not!

61
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,372
Oh!

62
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,088
This is sure to give me that
which I desire.

63
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,125
Wait for me, my sea crown.

64
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,060
Hmm?
What?

65
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,459
Who are you?

66
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,364
You want this to satisfy
your selfish desires.

67
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,560
Not happening.

68
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,898
Seize him!
Now!

69
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,130
Seize him!

70
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,865
Ohh!

71
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,504
Bye!

72
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,453
- Huh?
- Traitor! Stop him!

73
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,192
Excuse me.
I'm not a traitor.

74
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,560
I was never on your side!

75
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,573
Ow!

76
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,641
Aah!

77
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,242
Hello, there, Headquarters.
This is Jack Walker checking in.

78
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,350
Well, well, Jackie.
You're late.

79
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,075
EOP confirmed.

80
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,518
EOP? You mean "Equal Opportunity
Publications"?

81
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,748
"Egg of the Prince. "

82
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,017
So, pretty cool name, huh?

83
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,957
You can't just make up names.

84
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,290
Look, first, I get stuck
on this ship,

85
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,628
scrubbing stinking floors
for a solid month.

86
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,033
Couldn't you think of something
nicer to say?

87
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,036
As soon as our work is through.

88
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,698
There's a lot left.
You man enough?

89
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,208
I don't know the meaning
of the word "failure. "

90
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,369
- You don't?
- Huh?

91
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,504
Would you like to borrow
my dictionary?

92
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,309
No, thanks.

93
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,211
Ha!

94
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,525
- Oh!
- Aah!

95
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,854
Ugh!

96
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,132
There he is!

97
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll just take that
off your hands now.

98
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,417
Pinsir!

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,221
Parasect!

100
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,419
Give it up.

101
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,587
Give it up!

102
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,791
I don't know the meaning
of the phrase "give it up. "

103
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:48,764
Capiche?

104
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,925
Really?

105
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,196
I'll lend you my dictionary.

106
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,203
Keep it.

107
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:01,675
Huh?

108
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,852
Capture on!

109
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,890
Capture complete.

110
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,569
Now, Mantine!

111
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,300
Ooh.

112
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,545
Ha!

113
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,821
Whoo!

114
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:51,358
That's Mantine's Confuse Ray!

115
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,863
And it works great.

116
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,193
Pinsir, Pinsir.

117
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,630
Pinsir, Pinsir.

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,406
Pokémon Ranger, eh?

119
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,226
Oh, just tell me again, Brock.

120
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,729
Are you really sure
this is the right way to go?

121
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,663
I used to think so,
but now I'm not so sure.

122
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,395
We haven't seen a town
or anything.

123
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,870
And the Pokémap's not picking up
a signal at all.

124
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,136
It appears
that nature's protecting arms

125
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,679
have gotten quite a bit warmer
than our heroes would like.

126
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,477
And although hoping for a quick
arrival in the next town,

127
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,812
their hopes have been dashed

128
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,511
as they sadly conclude
they've now lost their way,

129
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,351
wandering in a veritable
wasteland.

130
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,490
Man, I'm so thirsty.

131
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,959
Give me some water, okay?

132
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,121
Just don't drink it all.

133
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,392
I won't.
Thanks.

134
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:11,928
Aah!

135
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,562
Max, I told you not to drink it
all, didn't I?

136
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,607
It wasn't exactly full,
you know.

137
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,403
But now that I know
there's none left,

138
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,273
I'm even thirstier than ever.

139
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,314
Water.

140
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,609
Hmm?

141
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,680
Huh?

142
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,651
Ah!

143
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,955
One, two, three.

144
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,760
Go!

145
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,459
Wow!
What's all that?

146
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,366
Hello!
- Hmm?

147
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,767
Can we have some water?

148
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,771
Okay.

149
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,307
All right!

150
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,342
Whoa!

151
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,245
Hi, there.
Who are you?

152
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,509
My name's Ash.

153
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,617
And I'm Max.

154
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,117
And I'm May.

155
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,189
We've been traveling,
and I think we got lost.

156
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,619
Pika! Pika!

157
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,726
Poliwhirl!

158
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,986
- Poli!
- Poli!

159
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,858
Pikachu!

160
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,489
That's what you were doing.

161
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,363
They're using Psychic.

162
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,095
Huh?

163
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,103
Huh.

164
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,798
Hmm.

165
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,707
Hmm.

166
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,607
You're in the Marina Underwater
Pokémon Show, correct?

167
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,442
That's right.

168
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,552
And your name is Lizabeth,
and you're the star of the show.

169
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,813
Right again.

170
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,421
Awesome!

171
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,683
The name is Brock, my dear.

172
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,261
I happen to know
all about the Marina Group!

173
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,260
Here!
It's my blue book.

174
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,364
There.
See?

175
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,764
You're the tippy-top of my
all-time favorite stars list.

176
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,167
This has got to be destiny,
meeting you here like this!

177
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,567
Yes, take my hand.

178
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,334
And now that we're
holding hands,

179
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,340
I would love to go
on a swimming date with you

180
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,502
and all your wonderful
Pokémon... Aah!

181
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,945
Now that I'm holding your ear,
I'd like to take you away.

182
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,516
Lizabeth, what's wrong?

183
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,083
Grandpa, it's okay.

184
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,653
These people were on the road
and got lost.

185
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,723
You must all be her family.

186
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:12,983
Yes.
That's right.

187
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,114
Grandad and Dad.

188
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,090
- Hi. I'm Ship.
- And I'm Kyle.

189
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,889
The name's Meredith.

190
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,328
Don't tell me.
You're not her mom?

191
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,490
- Yes, I am.
- Wow!

192
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,068
You look like you could be
her sister.

193
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,070
Oh, go on, dear.
I mean, go on!

194
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,537
Aah!

195
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,766
- Wooper.
- Wooper.

196
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,035
- Wooper.
- Wooper.

197
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,542
- Wooper.
- Wooper.

198
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,872
Politoed.
Politoed.

199
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,275
Politoed.
Politoed.

200
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,642
Politoed.
Politoed.

201
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,443
Politoed.
Politoed.

202
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,016
Mmm.

203
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,244
Ah!

204
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,887
That's good.

205
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,387
Ah!
The best.

206
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,491
Oh, yeah.

207
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,956
Pika!

208
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,324
I've never petted
a Buizel before.

209
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,090
Buizel really likes you.

210
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,257
Anybody ready for some more?

211
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,834
Oh, yeah, please.

212
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,334
Me too!

213
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,562
Pika!

214
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,535
Huh?

215
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,044
Excuse me.

216
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,143
Your show sounds really cool.
What do you do in it?

217
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,152
Would you like a sample?

218
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,085
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

219
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,088
Yeah! Yeah!

220
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,659
Then we'll just have to
show you!

221
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,101
Ooh!

222
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,102
Ooh!

223
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,983
Ah! Mm!
Mm! Mm! Mm!

224
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,216
Buizel.

225
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,124
B- B-B...

226
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,337
Hmm.
Look at that.

227
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,776
Oh.

228
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,736
Hmm?

229
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,981
Bui.

230
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,056
So, how would you all like
a lift to the next town?

231
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,322
- Yeah.
- That'd be great.

232
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,398
Huh?

233
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,761
Bui.

234
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,426
- Hmm.
- What are you gawking at?

235
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,935
The Team Rocket Gazette.

236
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,937
Yes!
Right there!

237
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:55,938
Looky.

238
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,066
That's what the twerpette had
in tow.

239
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,269
Pursued by the Phantom, too.

240
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,903
There's big money to be made
from this kind of dirt.

241
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,743
Why not phone Phantom?

242
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,475
I would think
clueing him in on this

243
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,450
would entitle us to a piece
of what must be big treasure.

244
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,351
Love that word.

245
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,997
Hello.
Is this 1-800-PHANTOM?

246
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,465
It's about the item
you've been searching for.

247
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,229
Yes, that one!

248
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,065
- We've got to go!
- Hmm?

249
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,004
Got to run.
I'm all out of quarters.

250
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,541
Wait for me!

251
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,359
Bui.

252
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,488
Bui.

253
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,674
Bui.

254
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,819
Hu!

255
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,522
Gorebyss!

256
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,499
Oh!

257
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,160
- Chinchou!
- Chinchou!

258
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,363
- Chinchou!
- Chinchou!

259
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,723
Mana!

260
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,595
Mana! Mana! Mana!

261
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,268
Whee!

262
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,772
Mana! Mana!

263
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,967
Wait!
Don't go!

264
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,740
Don't go!
Stop!

265
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:18,650
What's wrong, May?

266
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,084
Uh, nothing.

267
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,813
- Morning.
- Bui.

268
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,183
Uh, right.

269
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,757
Good morning.

270
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,159
And in.

271
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,990
Out.

272
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,097
Steady, boy.

273
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,392
Right.

274
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,192
Bui.

275
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,099
Pika. Pika.

276
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,035
Bui.

277
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,478
Presenting your
freshly baked pizza.

278
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,579
Down we go.

279
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,880
- In we go.
- In we go.

280
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,456
Don't worry, treasure.

281
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,821
Jessie's here to bring
your valuable self home.

282
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,792
No hiding.

283
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,462
Last night I had
the strangest dream.

284
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,329
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,300
A Pokémon I'd never seen before

286
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,134
was traveling to some sort
of an underwater sea temple.

287
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,368
Mana!
Mana! Mana! Mana!

288
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,980
I really wanted to
go along, too.

289
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,413
Sea temple?

290
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,449
I'd sure like to go there.

291
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,314
Pika.

292
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,580
Yeah, but it was just a dream.

293
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,723
Father.

294
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,415
I've heard of stranger things
than that.

295
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,789
Tell me, have you ever heard of
the People of the Water?

296
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,192
Why, no.

297
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,629
Who are they?

298
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,735
You two do the honors.

299
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,300
Truth is, I've had
exactly the same dream.

300
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,135
Oh?

301
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,903
You see, our family
is made up of descendants

302
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,980
of the ones that have been
called the People of the Water.

303
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,844
Right. And there aren't
that many of us left.

304
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,382
Mm.

305
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,918
Amazing.

306
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,022
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

307
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,886
Hmm?

308
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,255
Ooh!

309
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,259
- Here we go.
- Huh?

310
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,795
Not another egg.

311
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,694
Another egg, my eye.

312
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,029
- Aah!
- Huh?

313
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,604
Oh!

314
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,643
Aah!

315
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,767
Aah!

316
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,880
Aah!

317
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,106
Aah!

318
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,948
Oh, that was "eggs-treme. "

319
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,779
Huh?

320
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,387
What do you think you're doing

321
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,614
with James' voice?

322
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,279
Yikes!

323
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,358
The same thing you're doing
with Jessie's!

324
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,518
I'm swearing off egg jokes!

325
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,832
Bu! Bu!

326
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:48,660
Pika?

327
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,325
The People of the Water
traveled the oceans

328
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,871
and lived together in peace and
harmony with the water Pokémon.

329
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,031
So in order to receive
the ocean's blessings

330
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,110
and show their gratitude to
the Pokémon, our ancestors built

331
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,078
what has come to be known
as the Sea Temple.

332
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,115
That must be the one
in your dream.

333
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,411
- You even got the name right.
- Wow.

334
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,714
The People of the Water still
see the temple in their dreams.

335
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,619
A memory written
straight into your DNA?

336
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,852
That's just awesome.

337
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,928
Why did May have the dream?

338
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,224
Maybe that means
May's a descendant

339
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,266
of the People of the Water...
and me too!

340
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,994
Could be.
Why not?

341
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,661
Stop being me!

342
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,932
Don't you see
I look ridiculous?

343
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,599
You're not the only one, lady!

344
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,870
Oh, no.
What if the boss finds out?

345
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,809
Easy.
Deny everything.

346
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,507
Easy?
What kind of dope are you?

347
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,512
Team Rocket!

348
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,984
Okay, what are you doing here?

349
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,590
Prepare for trouble
with the things you see.

350
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,623
These earrings are just not me.

351
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,489
An evil as old as the galaxy.

352
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,597
Sent here to fulfill
our destiny.

353
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,756
Meowth!
That's me!

354
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,102
- This isn't working.
- Who cares?

355
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,865
With this baby,
we'll never have to work again.

356
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,837
Sounds good.

357
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,963
What's that?

358
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,007
- Huh?
- Huh?

359
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,008
Aah!

360
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,875
What I wouldn't give right now
for my beautiful long legs.

361
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,279
How does Meowth do it?

362
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,943
Out of the way, short stuff!

363
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:16,985
Whee!

364
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,953
Eat my dust, peewee pegs!

365
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,114
Shut up!

366
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,057
I won't forget this!

367
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,998
Huh?

368
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,158
And it's lift-off
from Loser Land!

369
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,929
Pikachu, Thunderbolt!

370
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,628
Pika!

371
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,137
- Hold on.
- Pika?

372
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,673
They've got something
very important.

373
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,174
We can't risk damage.

374
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,608
Right.

375
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,575
Huh?

376
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,445
A Fearow.

377
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,244
Capture on!

378
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,085
Ha! Ha!

379
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,088
A Pokémon Ranger?

380
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,662
Worse than short legs.

381
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,731
Fearow, lend me your power!

382
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,571
Pikachu, you go, too.

383
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,900
Pika.

384
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,538
Huh?

385
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,739
Oh!

386
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,078
Pika.

387
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,446
Wait!
Come on!

388
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,554
Must it get personal?

389
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,655
Oh!

390
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,950
Better not let go!

391
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,393
- Oh!
- Oh!

392
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,467
Aah!

393
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,400
Meowth, do something right now!

394
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,598
Me?
You're Meowth!

395
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,537
Aah!

396
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,269
Where's a good shrink
when you need one?

397
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:50,677
- We're blasting off again!
- We're blasting off again!

398
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,554
Pika!

399
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,049
Pika!

400
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,390
You were a great help, Fearow.

401
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,691
Thanks a lot.

402
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,870
Hey, that's a Capture Styler.

403
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,028
Does that mean...

404
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,969
- You're a Pokémon Ranger?
- You're a Pokémon Ranger?

405
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,540
Mm-hmm.

406
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,809
Jack Walker.

407
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,916
Call me Jackie, please.

408
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,145
I'm on a mission right now.

409
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,485
And the Marina Group is helping
me out with it in a big way.

410
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,920
Glad to help, Jackie.

411
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,529
I'm sorry we couldn't tell you.

412
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,191
This is the egg
of a Pokémon called Manaphy.

413
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,529
Manaphy?

414
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,601
Pika.

415
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,204
I've heard of it.

416
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,637
It's a Pokémon that travels
the oceans.

417
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,572
Sounds to me like you study
quite a lot, Max.

418
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,702
I read that it's super-rare

419
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,542
and hardly anybody's
ever seen one before.

420
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,546
Right.

421
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,241
My mission is to see

422
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,716
that this Manaphy egg gets
properly hatched

423
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:06,585
and then delivered to Samiya,
the Sea Temple.

424
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,622
Then that's the temple
I saw in my dream!

425
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,820
Correct.

426
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,555
And that must have been Manaphy.

427
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,529
You mean you saw it
in your dream?

428
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,935
Uh-huh.

429
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,333
You're lucky, May.

430
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,939
- Pika?
- Huh?

431
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:22,869
Aah!

432
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,999
- Huh?
- What's wrong, Buizel?

433
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,543
Pika.

434
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,914
- Huh?
- Huh?

435
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,419
Target is confirmed
and within our sights.

436
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,462
Within our sights!

437
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,461
They must have followed us
all the way here.

438
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,733
We've got to hurry and get back
to the trailer.

439
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,312
- But what about...
- Max, hurry!

440
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,789
Huh?

441
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,020
- Aah!
- Aah!

442
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,462
- The Beedrills!
- Run!

443
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,826
Remember,
there are only two types

444
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,461
of people on this planet...
those who are chased

445
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,868
and those who do the chasing.

446
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,839
I know which is better.

447
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,211
I go for the role of chaser
every time.

448
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,042
Pokémon Ranger!

449
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,812
Now I suggest it's time for you

450
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,786
to learn the meaning
of "give up" once and for all.

451
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,359
It's a shame you have to travel
here all that way,

452
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,189
but I'm afraid you have to
go home empty-handed.

453
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,558
Why, you impudent...

454
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,427
Why, you impudent...

455
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,061
Come back here!

456
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,977
Give me that.
Now!

457
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,712
Well, if you want it that bad,
here you go!

458
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,222
Huh?

459
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,451
You're not getting away
with this!

460
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,979
Man, you're strong, Phantom.
You take vitamins?

461
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,948
Ash!

462
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,518
All right.
There you are!

463
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,713
We've got to get
out of here quick!

464
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,551
Pika.

465
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,386
You think you're so smart.

466
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,154
Now, Beedrill!
Use Pin Missile!

467
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,128
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

468
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,324
Pika!

469
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,731
Let's go!

470
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,463
Stop them with Sludge Bomb,
Beedrill!

471
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,069
Aah!

472
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,905
Hey, May!

473
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,408
Back to the trailer!

474
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,484
Those guys are all after
the egg.

475
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,052
Got it, Ash.

476
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,280
Pikachu, Volt Tackle!

477
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,388
Pika!

478
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,690
Pika, Pika!

479
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,056
Huh?
What's going on?

480
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,896
It's glowing.

481
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,628
Now, give me that!

482
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,795
Give me that!

483
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,406
Max, hurry!

484
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,805
Now...

485
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,935
that belongs to me.

486
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,845
No! Manaphy doesn't belong
to anyone!

487
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:54,749
Anything that has no owner
belongs to me.

488
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,478
Ohh!

489
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,645
Don't you dare hurt my sister!

490
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,582
Hey!
Give that to me!

491
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,710
It's mine!

492
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,187
Oh!

493
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,458
- Oh!
- Oh!

494
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,687
Mana?

495
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,256
Phy! Phy!

496
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,826
Oh!
Oh, no. It's okay.

497
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,485
Yes, everything's going to be
just fine.

498
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,619
Just fine.

499
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,959
The egg hatched.

500
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,294
That's it. That's it.
That's it. Yes!

501
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,871
But I was gonna use my own
two hands to hatch Manaphy.

502
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,700
Manaphy! Manaphy!

503
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,574
Everybody okay?

504
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,144
Over here!

505
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,075
- Huh?
- Huh?

506
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,305
Quick.

507
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,377
Stop!

508
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,042
No, home is that way!

509
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,153
That's it.
Take a trip!

510
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,255
Aah!

511
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,590
Phy! Phy!

512
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,562
Phy! Phy!

513
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,564
There, there.
There, there.

514
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,067
Don't cry, sweetie.
Don't cry, sweetie.

515
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,431
Don't cry.

516
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,038
Phy.

517
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,868
Mana?

518
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,369
Hey, thanks, Lizabeth.

519
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,537
- I think.
- Bui!

520
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,651
Phy. Phy.

521
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,483
I think we're finally
calming down.

522
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,090
Manaphy must be tired.

523
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,318
- I can take over for you now.
- Thanks.

524
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,863
Mana! Mana!

525
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,227
No.
Not again.

526
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,959
Stop, please.

527
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,730
May, I'm afraid
Manaphy prefers you.

528
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,168
Mana!

529
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,297
# Da-da-da #

530
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,500
- # Da-da-da #
- Mana!

531
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,871
Oh.

532
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,407
I'm getting the feeling

533
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,913
that Manaphy thinks
you're its mother.

534
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,710
- Huh?
- I think she's right.

535
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,649
Often, whoever a Pokémon sees
after hatching

536
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,949
is assumed to be its mother.

537
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,383
So I'm a... a mom?

538
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,222
- Yep.
- Pika.

539
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,296
Pika.
Pika!

540
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,491
What's up?

541
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,691
Pika.

542
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,170
Pika, Pika.

543
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,708
- They're back!
- Pika!

544
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,549
Stop the trailer now.

545
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,417
Stop now!

546
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,221
- Oh!
- Oh!

547
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,403
- Oh!
- Oh!

548
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,570
Quick!
Everybody move up to the front!

549
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,387
May!

550
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,988
Help me!

551
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,514
Lizabeth!

552
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,979
Phy.

553
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:21,516
Phy.

554
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,880
It's okay, Manaphy.

555
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,214
Mana?

556
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,047
Phy.

557
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,520
Everything will be fine.

558
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,352
Guess it's not easy being a mom.

559
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,188
Thanks for the wisdom, Max.

560
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,488
Mana.

561
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,862
It's got to be near here.

562
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,662
Just a little farther.

563
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,634
I just had the worst dream.

564
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,338
For some strange reason,
I was Meowth.

565
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,881
Really? Weird.
I was you.

566
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,349
Yeah. I was you.
Blue hair and all.

567
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,921
Then it couldn't have been
a dream, could it?

568
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,580
Wobbuffet!

569
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,522
Mime, Mime, Mime!

570
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,685
Now, what are you two doing?

571
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,592
Wobbuffet!

572
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,699
Mime, Mime, Mime!

573
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,268
It's the twerp truck!

574
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,171
- Mime!
- Wob!

575
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,335
We've still got it.
Oh, yeah.

576
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,751
Guess if you want something
bad enough.

577
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:35,984
I did it!

578
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,460
Come on, they didn't find
this place because of you.

579
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,191
Did too,
and I'm sure there's a reward.

580
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,960
We want the whole treasure!

581
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:44,999
Hold on.

582
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,604
I think our boy
is onto something.

583
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,296
It's time to retool.

584
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,775
Do you have
any water-type Pokémon?

585
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:35,611
Yeah.

586
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,913
In that case, it's your turn.

587
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,366
A dead end?

588
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,375
Watch.

589
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,461
These ruins were left
by the People of the Water,

590
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,363
which means
that must be who they are.

591
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,939
Phy!

592
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,514
Mana!

593
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,650
- Mana!
- Pika?

594
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,724
Mana!

595
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,460
- Oh!
- Oh!

596
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,695
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

597
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,829
Dewgong, return.

598
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,374
Good work.

599
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,171
Thank you.

600
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,358
It's exactly like I saw it
in my dream.

601
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,726
Huh?

602
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,835
It's the temple, Samiya.

603
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,561
Samiya?

604
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,663
Within the temple, there is
a treasure called the Sea Crown.

605
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,706
Sea Crown?

606
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,243
Many thieves have appeared
over the years

607
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,609
attempting to steal
the Sea Crown.

608
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,808
So to protect the
treasure and the temple itself,

609
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,919
the People of the Water
set traps within the temple.

610
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,385
What kind?

611
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,288
The Sea Temple can't be seen
by the eyes of the mortals.

612
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,189
Wow!
How is that?

613
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,796
It blends in with the water.

614
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,956
Once, the temple was carried
away by the tides.

615
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,362
And since then,

616
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,403
the temple has drifted
along the ocean continuously,

617
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,836
making it impossible to find.

618
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,704
However, the temple appears now

619
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,641
only at the time of
the total eclipse of the Moon.

620
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,338
That's when
the People of the Water

621
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,108
were said to have held
their festival

622
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,751
honoring the water Pokémon.

623
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,355
Wow.
A temple that travels the ocean.

624
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,421
But wait.

625
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,549
Since it can't be seen,
how do you find it?

626
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,059
We think Manaphy can.

627
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,356
Mana!

628
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,432
The People of the Water
originally built the temple

629
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,468
in the exact same place
where the Manaphy lived.

630
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,039
Even after the temple
began to move about freely,

631
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,405
all Manaphy have been born
with a kind of homing instinct,

632
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,877
which allows them to locate
the temple at any time.

633
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,243
So as long as we've got Manaphy,

634
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,545
we'll be able to find
the temple.

635
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,655
So that's why all those men
were all after Manaphy.

636
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,688
- Mm.
- Mm.

637
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,792
They wanted to steal
the Sea Crown.

638
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,623
We must protect the Sea Temple
at all costs.

639
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,755
We must also protect Manaphy
at all costs,

640
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,766
especially from the crusty
old codger with the beard.

641
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,301
So, who is that guy?

642
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:13,732
Phantom the Pirate.

643
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,469
Phantom the Pirate.

644
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,302
He's one mean dude.

645
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,341
Search inside.

646
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,507
Search inside.

647
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,549
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

648
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,023
- The man of the hour!
- The man of the hour!

649
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,159
Who are you?

650
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,056
I'm James from Team Rocket,

651
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,561
humbly happy to have tipped
you off to those twerps.

652
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,029
I'm Jessie.

653
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,394
I'm Meowth.

654
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,933
Give them their reward.

655
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,127
Give them their reward.

656
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,295
Yes, sir.

657
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,498
Thank you, Your Highness.
You're too kind.

658
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,337
Word out on the street is that
you're the pirate's pajamas.

659
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,776
Perhaps you could use
some extra dirty hands.

660
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,316
How are you at cleaning?

661
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,419
- The dirtiest.
- The dirtiest.

662
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,728
It appears
that the People of the Water

663
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,030
employed quite an elaborate
system of water routes

664
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,105
for their trade.

665
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,731
So it's difficult
to pinpoint their exit.

666
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,845
They're now heading
for the Sea Temple,

667
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,142
so let us go and wait for them
to fall into our trap.

668
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,045
Our trap!

669
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,482
I'll get the Sea Crown
if it's the last thing I do.

670
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,885
The Sea Crown?

671
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,457
The mother lode.

672
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,150
Putting a capital "T"
on "treasure. "

673
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,695
- Treasure.
- Still love that word.

674
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,797
Mm-hmm.

675
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,232
Hmm.

676
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,088
Wow!

677
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,933
- Oh!
- Oh!

678
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,563
I want to thank you kids.

679
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,575
You've all been a big help to me
up to this point.

680
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,305
But now...

681
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,974
Once we get out of this grotto,
I'm leaving.

682
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,082
What?

683
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,516
Mana!

684
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,714
You see, you've gotten
too involved as it is.

685
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,686
How come?

686
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,158
This has to be
a Pokémon Ranger's job.

687
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,126
Aah!

688
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,673
Sorry to keep you waiting.

689
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,339
Thank you.

690
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,318
Manaphy's sound asleep.

691
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,185
Must be tired.

692
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,226
Yeah, after a day
like we just had.

693
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,320
Not to mention the fact that
Manaphy's still only a baby.

694
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,196
They're here.

695
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,500
That's my ship, all right.

696
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,166
The Blue Lagoon.

697
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,335
- That's your ship?
- Pika!

698
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,346
Right. I traveled
the whole world on that ship

699
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,540
when I was a young man.

700
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,552
You've kept my boat shipshape
all these years.

701
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,986
Always feel free to use it.

702
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,715
But we want to go with you!

703
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,452
There's still so many good times
left to share.

704
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,290
All of your kind words
are plenty.

705
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,762
Captain!

706
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,325
We'll have a drink
upon my return.

707
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,368
Take care.

708
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,596
But, Captain Ship!

709
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,502
Ohh!

710
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,608
Safe trip!

711
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,175
Bye, Captain!

712
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,446
Bye, Lizabeth!
I'll miss you!

713
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,428
Phy.

714
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,196
Man.

715
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,034
I wish we could have gone.

716
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,109
There's so much more
I want to learn about Manaphy.

717
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,735
And there's so much more
I want to learn about Lizabeth!

718
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,872
It's frustrating
just seeing them off like this.

719
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:53,675
Pika.

720
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,012
I feel so strange.

721
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,881
What is it?

722
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:01,691
Mana!

723
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,293
Mana! Mana!

724
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,122
Mana!

725
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,060
Mana!

726
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,130
Mana!

727
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,164
Being young means you never turn
away from adventure, you know.

728
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,799
What are you afraid of?
This is your chance.

729
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,344
If you want to go,
then you should go.

730
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,176
There's nothing worse
than regret, kid.

731
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,343
Pika!

732
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,818
- Hey, guys!
- Wait up!

733
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,192
Hey, hold on, everybody!

734
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,729
We want to go with you, too!

735
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,457
I'm coming, Manaphy!

736
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,794
It's May.

737
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,560
And Ash.

738
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,533
Mana!

739
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,366
Phy!

740
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,381
Aah!

741
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,211
This is weird.

742
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,221
What in the world
is happening to me?

743
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,489
What am I doing here?

744
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,062
Phy!

745
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,069
Hey! You forgot me!

746
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,899
Stop that ship!

747
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,939
This won't work.

748
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,008
Manaphy, you did this?

749
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,407
Mana! Mana! Mana!

750
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,309
What are you gonna do?

751
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,147
Pika?

752
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,257
Whoa, I'm back to normal.

753
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,087
You and I switched bodies.

754
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,526
Is that one of Manaphy's powers?

755
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,325
Yeah, it's called Heart Swap,

756
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,230
and it's one of the ways
Manaphy avoids danger.

757
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,428
The effect wears off
after a little while.

758
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,734
Though I'm not sure what will
happen if you get too far away.

759
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,275
Wow.
Amazing.

760
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,105
Hey, that's the Prince
of the Sea.

761
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,907
Who's the Prince of the Sea?

762
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,914
That's what they call Manaphy.

763
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,520
Say, Manaphy,
you didn't want me to leave?

764
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,123
Is that why you switched
Ash and Jackie?

765
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,758
Mana, Mana!

766
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,156
You make me so happy.

767
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,229
Happy! Happy!

768
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,332
You were talking!

769
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,990
Really?
Are you sure.

770
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,362
Sure, I'm sure.

771
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,402
- Say "happy. "
- Happy!

772
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,971
Hear that?
Manaphy's saying what I say.

773
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:30,971
Pika!

774
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,837
Well, I remember the first thing

775
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,001
that Lizabeth said
was "foo-foo. "

776
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,045
- That means "food," right?
- Uh-huh.

777
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,149
- You sure loved to eat.
- What?

778
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,944
Say "Ash," Manaphy.

779
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,212
- Come on and say "Ash. "
- Now say "Hi, Max. "

780
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,252
Mana.

781
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,619
Wow!
I heard you say "Max. "

782
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,350
Didn't sound like "Max" to me.

783
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,926
No?

784
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,085
Happy.

785
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,356
- You're so cute!
- Happy.

786
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,571
All right, May,
you can release Manaphy now.

787
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:05,402
Now?

788
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,739
From now on, Manaphy needs to
choose its own path.

789
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,107
By itself?

790
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,578
Right.

791
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,945
It's the way that it has to be.

792
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,018
All that we can do
is just watch.

793
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,086
Time for you to go, Manaphy,
by yourself.

794
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,556
Mana!

795
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,059
Are you ready to go?

796
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,184
Mana! Mana!

797
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,594
Okay.

798
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,427
Mana! Mana!

799
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,535
Mana!

800
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,905
Phy!

801
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,310
Phy!

802
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,214
Good. Let's go.

803
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,833
All right, down this way.

804
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:14,869
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

805
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,313
Wow!

806
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,438
Pika!

807
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,142
It's like an aquarium!

808
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:32,762
Manaphy!

809
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,090
Bui!

810
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,791
Mana!

811
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,731
Phy!

812
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,329
Come on. Okay.
It doesn't hurt.

813
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:45,901
Phy?

814
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,635
Mana! Mana! Mana!

815
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,540
Mana!

816
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,704
Mana! Mana!

817
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,483
Mana! Mana!

818
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,827
All alone.

819
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:11,263
That's the way Manaphy
will travel the entire ocean,

820
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,895
finally returning to its home,
which is the Sea Temple.

821
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,665
But how?

822
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,776
How does Manaphy know
where to go?

823
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,605
It's so strange.

824
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,119
The total lunar eclipse
is coming soon.

825
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,948
If our timing is just right,

826
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,420
we might get a chance to view
the Sea Temple

827
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,048
with our own eyes.

828
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,091
And receive the blessings
of the sea,

829
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,719
as the People of the Water did.

830
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,908
This is Jack Walker here,
en route, no problems.

831
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,445
Jackie, please.

832
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,674
Save the vacation
for when you're done.

833
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,783
Okay.

834
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,717
But there's not a single bad guy
in sight, so just relax.

835
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,521
Being a Pokémon Ranger
is just so cool.

836
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,721
Pikachu.

837
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,125
Phy! Phy!

838
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,088
- Oh!
- Bui!

839
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,749
- Oh!
- Oh!

840
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,132
Manaphy's sitting
on that Wailord.

841
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,366
Look at that.

842
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,102
Hi, Manaphy!

843
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,040
Hap!

844
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,808
Py!

845
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,473
Happy!

846
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,921
Bui! Bu, Bu.

847
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,259
Bui!

848
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,199
Shh!

849
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:36,777
Pika.

850
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,289
Hey, so, why'd you become
a Pokémon Ranger

851
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,153
in the first place, Jackie?

852
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,954
I was a kid.

853
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:55,792
I got stuck,
and these Pokémon saved my life.

854
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,559
I was hiking up in the mountains

855
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,639
when a sudden blizzard came up,
trapping me.

856
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,866
It just kept blowing harder
and harder.

857
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:09,035
I thought that was the end
for sure.

858
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,912
I'd never experienced
bitter cold like that before.

859
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,657
When, all of a sudden,

860
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,259
this group of migrating
forest Pokémon was there.

861
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,521
And one by one, they
started to gather 'round me,

862
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,427
like a bunch
of hot-water bottles.

863
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,608
You're so warm.

864
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,966
If they hadn't been
so kind to me back then,

865
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,470
I wouldn't be here today.

866
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,337
I guess I wanted to be
a Pokémon Ranger ever since.

867
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,103
Wow.
Great story.

868
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,371
Pika, Pika.

869
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,811
I was about the same age as you.

870
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,974
Yeah? Cool!

871
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,419
All right, Ranger Ash,
let 'er rip!

872
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,082
Phy!

873
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,491
Mana! Mana! Mana!

874
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,397
Pikachu.

875
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,362
Bui!

876
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,411
Phy!

877
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,443
Bui!

878
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,364
Pika!

879
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,100
Mana!

880
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,007
I love you, Manaphy.

881
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,838
Can you say, "I love you"?

882
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,138
Love?

883
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,406
"Love you. "

884
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,311
Mana love.

885
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,543
"Love you. "

886
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,277
Love you.

887
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,649
Right! "Love you"!

888
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,384
Mana love you!

889
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,822
Phy!

890
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,491
Lap!

891
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,694
Mana! Mana! Mana!

892
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,328
Mana!

893
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,304
Manaphy sure looks happy.

894
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,636
Pika.

895
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,109
You don't think
Manaphy will get lost.

896
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,804
Don't you worry, May.

897
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:58,914
But...

898
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,039
Come on.
You worry too much.

899
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,913
Children need freedom to grow,
or else, you know.

900
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,213
Oh, who asked you, Max?

901
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,686
Manaphy!

902
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,883
Love!
Love you!

903
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,030
You're really quite a chef.

904
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,234
Hey, thanks, Lizabeth.

905
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,811
Perhaps you could teach
my daughter how to cook.

906
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,846
Bui! Bui, Bui.

907
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,744
Mana!

908
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,851
Mana!

909
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,816
Mana!

910
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,057
Ah.

911
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:50,159
Ash, I need to ask you a favor.

912
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,358
What is it?

913
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,800
Please help separate Manaphy
and May.

914
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,202
But they're having so much fun.

915
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,171
Why would I do that?

916
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,971
If those two continue to get
closer and closer,

917
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,272
Manaphy won't want to leave.

918
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,472
And then...

919
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,583
Please.
You won't have to worry.

920
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,718
May.

921
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,786
I'll be fine.
I promise.

922
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:12,979
What about Manaphy?

923
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,818
Put yourself in Manaphy's place
for just a moment.

924
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:16,983
Oh.

925
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,357
Remember, Manaphy
is the Prince of the Sea

926
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,660
and destined to become leader
of all the Sea Temple Pokémon.

927
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,064
I hadn't thought of that.

928
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,501
You can't expect Manaphy
to stay with you forever.

929
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,840
That's the way of nature.

930
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,081
Happy! Happy, happy!

931
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,518
I'm sorry.

932
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,365
Happy!

933
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,493
Happy! Love you!

934
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,230
Happy!

935
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:11,041
Lizabeth, hi.

936
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,341
I know it's hard.

937
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,768
- Lan!
- Lan!

938
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:56,154
I've seen no evidence they have
any idea we're following them.

939
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,955
And let's keep it that way
until they reach the temple.

940
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,393
Reach the temple.

941
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,828
Yes, sir.

942
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,402
Hey, guys, the old treasure
meter's going off the charts.

943
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:07,764
It won't be long now.

944
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,667
We'll clean up
in more ways than one.

945
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,138
That old crusty crab
thinks he's so smart,

946
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,936
when we're the ones
poised to pocket

947
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,169
those diamonds and pearls.

948
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,643
Hey, that sounds like
a good name for a gang.

949
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,442
Wobbuffet!

950
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:50,703
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #

951
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,679
Hear that?
That's Manaphy singing.

952
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:57,319
Yeah.

953
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,920
Pika.

954
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:06,022
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #

955
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,495
# Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh #

956
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:14,194
Prince of the Sea.

957
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,340
Isn't Manaphy amazing?

958
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,848
Here, May,
I want you to have this.

959
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,746
The People of the Water's mark.

960
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,322
I'd like for you to wear it.

961
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,051
Thank you, Lizabeth.

962
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:15,889
Tonight's the night.
The total lunar eclipse.

963
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,556
I hope we're on time.

964
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,066
It's up to Manaphy
and the whimsy of the ocean.

965
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,830
I guess so.

966
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,246
Manaphy, it's time to eat.

967
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,348
Mana!

968
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,882
Mana!

969
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,543
Happy? Happy?

970
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,121
Guess Manaphy's looking for May.

971
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,986
- Pika.
- Happy?

972
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,424
Mm-hmm.

973
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,098
Come out, everybody.

974
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,289
Donphan!

975
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,367
Aipom!

976
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,299
Corphish!

977
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,665
- Swellow!
- Sceptile!

978
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,329
Phy!

979
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,235
Phy!

980
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,807
Donphan!

981
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,409
Mana!

982
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,135
Swellow!

983
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,040
Mana!

984
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,806
Phy!

985
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,209
Swellow!

986
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,908
Mana! Mana!

987
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,311
Phy!

988
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,921
Swellow!

989
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,557
Scep.

990
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,783
Scep!

991
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:17,756
Tile!

992
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:19,657
Swell!

993
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,094
Mana!

994
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,256
Corphish.

995
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,628
Cor.

996
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,599
- Mana!
- Cor!

997
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,097
- Phy!
- Corphish.

998
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,974
- Mana.
- Corphish.

999
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,078
- Mana.
- Corphish.

1000
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,839
- Mana, Mana.
- Corphish.

1001
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,470
- Mana, Mana.
- Corphish.

1002
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:42,015
Mana! Mana! Mana!

1003
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,152
Corphish!

1004
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,343
Mana! Mana!

1005
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,852
- Mana!
- Cor, Cor!

1006
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,253
Mana!

1007
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,462
Sharpedo.

1008
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,091
Mana.

1009
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,468
Mana!

1010
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,801
Shar.

1011
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:07,671
Mana.

1012
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,643
Hun.

1013
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,979
Mana?

1014
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,178
Mana!

1015
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,720
Cor!

1016
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,119
Corphish!

1017
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,987
Corphish!

1018
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,150
Corphish!

1019
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,626
Cor?

1020
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,458
Cor, Cor.

1021
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,202
Manaphy still hasn't
come back yet?

1022
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:35,861
No.

1023
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,495
I'm getting worried.

1024
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,403
Is something wrong?

1025
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,340
Now, don't do anything rash.

1026
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,711
Of course not.

1027
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,694
It's because of the way
I treated Manaphy.

1028
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,065
That's not true.
You can't blame yourself.

1029
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,144
Sir, they've just launched
a submarine.

1030
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,215
It's heading straight
for the bottom.

1031
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,112
Fine.

1032
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,446
From this point on,
I'm going it alone.

1033
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,383
Alone!

1034
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,820
- Wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.

1035
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,519
And that will be just as soon
as the Sea Crown is mine.

1036
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,690
Mana! Mana!

1037
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,231
Canth.

1038
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,200
Chinchou. Chinchou.

1039
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,832
Chinchou. Chinchou.

1040
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,604
Chinchou. Chinchou.

1041
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,942
Mana!

1042
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,953
Mana.

1043
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,489
Cloyster.

1044
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,218
Mana!

1045
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,989
Happy, happy!
Mana!

1046
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,727
Hun!

1047
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:13,835
Clamperl.

1048
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,369
Clamperl.

1049
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,773
Octil.

1050
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,178
Manaphy, where are you?

1051
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,645
It's me.
I'm right here.

1052
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,511
Please be okay.

1053
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:32,444
Pika!

1054
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,858
Phy!

1055
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:38,959
Manaphy!

1056
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,358
Love you.

1057
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,695
Happy, happy!

1058
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,701
But, Manaphy, that's what
you were looking for?

1059
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,805
Happy. Love you.

1060
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,133
And I love you, too.

1061
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,763
Aw.

1062
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,034
Pika.

1063
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,007
And that's what happened.

1064
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,739
Manaphy was just looking
for May's bandana.

1065
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,111
Now, that's some great news.

1066
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,444
Of course, you'll all be back
for supper.

1067
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,053
In that case,
I could use a little help.

1068
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,052
Don't worry.

1069
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,123
Brock and I will cook
as soon as we get back.

1070
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,953
Oh!

1071
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,592
Lizabeth, what's wrong?

1072
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,561
I think we're caught
in a riptide.

1073
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,497
- What?
- I've lost control!

1074
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,738
- Aah!
- Aah!

1075
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,172
Lizabeth!
Lizabeth!

1076
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,540
The radio's dead.

1077
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,878
Phy!

1078
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,321
Manaphy!

1079
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,252
Mana! Mana!

1080
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,518
We should go that way.

1081
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,649
Lizabeth.

1082
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,921
I'm on it.

1083
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,878
We're out of the current.

1084
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,816
Thanks to Manaphy.

1085
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,513
Mana! Mana!

1086
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,934
The lunar eclipse has begun.

1087
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,627
The current has calmed down,

1088
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,239
and it appears
they've all escaped unharmed.

1089
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,271
Corphish!

1090
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,807
Wonderful.

1091
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,075
They're being followed.

1092
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,544
By what?

1093
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,814
Hmm.

1094
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:57,861
What?

1095
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,932
What?

1096
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,629
They're gone!

1097
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,931
That can't be.
They've gone where?

1098
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,439
I think I know.

1099
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,568
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1100
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,582
It won't be long.
Almost there.

1101
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,106
- The Sea Temple!
- The Sea Temple!

1102
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,673
Wait.
What's that?

1103
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,509
It's Phantom!

1104
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,993
We can breathe in here.

1105
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,228
And we're still
so far underwater.

1106
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,133
Pretty cool, all right.

1107
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,031
Manaphy!

1108
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,404
Manaphy!

1109
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,111
Phy!

1110
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,880
Happy!

1111
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,454
Manaphy.

1112
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,821
Happy. Love you.

1113
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,153
Love you, too.

1114
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,455
Happy, happy.

1115
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,859
Pikachu.

1116
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,231
Mana?

1117
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,098
Happy?

1118
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,262
Phy!

1119
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,779
- Ah!
- Ah!

1120
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,598
# Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh #

1121
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,833
# Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh #

1122
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,603
# Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh #

1123
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,442
# Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh #

1124
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:31,417
Is that the temple
responding to Manaphy's song?

1125
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,579
# Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh #

1126
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,726
That's got to be the People
of the Water, for sure!

1127
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,835
Mana!

1128
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,842
Mana! Mana!

1129
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,173
Mana!

1130
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,941
Mana!

1131
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,353
Eureka!
The Sea Temple!

1132
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,288
The Sea Temple!
The Sea Temple!

1133
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,064
Of course, that would include
my beloved Sea Crown.

1134
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,460
Beloved Sea Crown!

1135
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:38,142
Oy!
My legs!

1136
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,912
What legs?

1137
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,717
- Treasure.
- Diamonds and pearls.

1138
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,123
Let's get through
this season first.

1139
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,572
Ahhh.

1140
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,450
Mana!

1141
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,222
Mana, Mana!

1142
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,162
Mana!

1143
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,817
Mana!

1144
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,684
- What's this?
- Pika?

1145
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,316
The sign of the Sea Crown!

1146
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,485
- Ohh.
- Huh?

1147
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,221
But what's it say?

1148
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,595
I don't know, Max.
Maybe Grandpa can read it.

1149
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,464
Would you like me to tell you
what it says, then, kids?

1150
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,467
Phantom!

1151
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,368
It's the least I can do to
thank you for guiding me here.

1152
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:06,371
No way!

1153
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,532
I warn you...

1154
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,144
Even if you are to attack me
all at once,

1155
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,303
you wouldn't stand a chance.

1156
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,311
Stand a chance!

1157
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,938
- Oh, yeah?
- Pika!

1158
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,141
You know you have no power here.

1159
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,445
This temple belongs
to the People of the Water.

1160
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,451
I happen to know everything
about the People of the Water.

1161
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,616
Everything!

1162
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,387
"Beyond this door,
which may only be opened

1163
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,554
with the People of the Water's
mark, lies the crown.

1164
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,757
And whosoever shall wear
this crown

1165
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,164
shall be known
as the King of the Sea. "

1166
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,098
As thanks for guiding me here,

1167
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,038
I shall be kind enough
to let you view the Sea Crown.

1168
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:43,144
That's the
People of the Water's mark.

1169
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,041
And I went through a lot
to get it.

1170
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,013
A lot to get it!
A lot to get it!

1171
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,276
Whoa!

1172
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,650
Fantastic!

1173
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,692
It's over now.

1174
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,039
Ahhh.

1175
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:13,465
Finally, the Sea Crown.
And now it's all mine.

1176
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,263
All mine!
All mine!

1177
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,099
- What a sight!
- Amazing.

1178
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,367
Remember, there are two types
of men in this world of ours...

1179
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:24,445
those who look good with rare
jewels and those who do not.

1180
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,912
For my money,
the Sea Crown and I

1181
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,381
are a match made
in the heavens above.

1182
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,284
Mana!
Mana, Mana!

1183
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,050
Mana!

1184
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,158
Mana!

1185
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,624
Mana, Mana!
Mana!

1186
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,924
Mana! Mana!

1187
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:46,865
Manaphy!

1188
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:47,991
That looks fun.

1189
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,398
Hmph.

1190
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,570
Mana, Mana!

1191
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,940
- Ugh!
- Mana!

1192
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:57,977
Manaphy!

1193
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,479
Mana!
Mana! Mana!

1194
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,776
What did you do?

1195
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,884
You can't take that!

1196
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,648
I've risked everything
to capture the Sea Crown.

1197
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,291
And from now on,
it belongs to me.

1198
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,756
Huh?

1199
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,264
Oh, no!
What happened?

1200
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,178
- Aah!
- Aah!

1201
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,761
Aah!

1202
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,669
Max, hold on!

1203
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,875
Let's go.
We got to get back to the sub.

1204
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:07,879
Wait!

1205
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:08,983
Aah!

1206
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,611
Huh?

1207
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,881
Come on!

1208
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:33,907
Everybody okay?

1209
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,272
Jackie!
- Where's Phantom?

1210
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,309
Back there.

1211
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,243
He took several jewels
from the Sea Crown.

1212
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,474
And all this water
started coming in.

1213
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:47,087
I'll take care of Phantom.
You get out of here.

1214
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,813
The temple is sinking.

1215
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,287
It's sinking?

1216
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,359
Lizabeth,
take care of everyone.

1217
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,358
Right.

1218
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,326
Wait!
It's bad in there!

1219
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:58,194
Don't worry, Ash.
I'll be fine.

1220
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,460
I'm a Ranger, right?

1221
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,495
- Hang in there, Jackie!
- Pika!

1222
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,335
Let's move!

1223
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,651
- Not bad for an old man.
- Hmm?

1224
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,722
But this belongs
to the People of the Water

1225
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,653
and the water Pokémon.

1226
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,783
You seem to have forgotten that.

1227
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,020
No!
This is all mine now.

1228
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,562
All mine now!

1229
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,565
It is, huh?
Your mind's on the fritz.

1230
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,601
I'll fix that!

1231
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:35,896
They're mine!

1232
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:40,706
Why, you impudent twit!

1233
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,571
Aaah!

1234
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,551
Well, Pokémon Ranger,
your time is up.

1235
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,457
Time is up!
Time is up!

1236
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,894
Unless I do something,
both of our times are up.

1237
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,795
Impossible.

1238
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,459
I'm just getting started!

1239
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,628
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1240
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,873
Aah!

1241
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,651
No!
Stop!

1242
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,158
Don't go!

1243
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,634
Phy!

1244
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:56,947
Mana!

1245
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,676
Hurry.
We have to go.

1246
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,288
Right.
- Mana!

1247
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,219
Mana! Mana!

1248
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,417
Manaphy!
May! No!

1249
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,152
Ash! May!
Wait!

1250
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,532
Manaphy, where are you going?

1251
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,939
Manaphy must be trying
to save the temple.

1252
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,773
Pikachu.

1253
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:27,211
Mana!

1254
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,351
Mana!

1255
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,113
Mana! Mana!

1256
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,119
It's the Sea Crown.

1257
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,190
Down there!

1258
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,156
Phy!

1259
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:41,319
Phy! Phy!

1260
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,930
Manaphy!

1261
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,964
Manaphy's trying to get
the temple back

1262
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,328
to the way it was before.

1263
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,561
And that's what
we're gonna do, too.

1264
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,227
Pika!

1265
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,861
We need one more.

1266
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,829
Oh, no.
Did Phantom have one?

1267
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,731
- Phy.
- Pika.

1268
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:33,546
So it is sinking.

1269
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:34,671
He was right.

1270
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,408
He was right!
Let's go.

1271
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,052
This joint's full of
treasure if you're thirsty.

1272
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,916
Hurry, there's barely
enough room for the three of us!

1273
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:44,184
How did you all get here?

1274
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,953
Get out of there this instant!

1275
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:46,719
There's no room
in this tub for a tub!

1276
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:49,457
Try a cruise ship!

1277
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:51,064
Go walk the plank, crank!

1278
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:51,893
Yeah?

1279
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,762
Well, I've got a plank
just for you!

1280
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,392
- Aah!
- Aah!

1281
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,231
Whoa!

1282
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,569
Aaah!

1283
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,508
We're blasting off again!

1284
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,655
Want to come?

1285
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,061
Want to come!
Want to come!

1286
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,628
It looks like Jackie managed
to get out of there.

1287
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,262
Huh?

1288
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,308
But May and Ash...

1289
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,802
Oh, no.
We're being pushed away.

1290
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,107
Not again!

1291
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,308
We just ran through here.

1292
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,032
Pika!
Pikachu!

1293
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,838
Huh?

1294
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,778
Got it!

1295
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:47,813
Pika!

1296
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,314
But how'd it get here?

1297
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,282
I'm not surprised,
with all the flooding going on.

1298
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,684
So all we do is put it back.

1299
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,222
- Look out!
- Huh?

1300
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,730
It's the Phantom's.
Huh?

1301
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,210
May, get in here.
It's Phantom's.

1302
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,319
Come on.
You got to.

1303
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,561
Pikachu, you take care
of the two of them.

1304
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:45,129
I have to go put this back.

1305
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:48,868
Now you guys just sit tight
in there and wait.

1306
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,308
- But, Ash!
- Pikachu!

1307
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,080
Oh, no.

1308
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:15,523
No, you don't!

1309
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:26,136
Hurry.

1310
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,969
Pika.

1311
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,847
Jackie, you all right?

1312
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:44,514
I'm just fine.
Where are the kids?

1313
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:46,557
May and Ash
haven't come back yet.

1314
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:47,991
What the...

1315
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,228
Please, Ash, don't give up.

1316
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,992
Pikachu.

1317
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,269
Please, Ash.

1318
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,174
Ash, don't give up.

1319
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,406
Ash, be strong!

1320
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:42,106
Pika.

1321
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,514
I know you can do it.
I know!

1322
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:46,244
Pikachu!

1323
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:11,866
Mana!

1324
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,166
Mana, Mana!

1325
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:35,752
Hey, look!

1326
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,468
Kyogre!

1327
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:22,008
Pika.

1328
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:26,471
Pika.

1329
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:32,479
Ash.
Ash must have done this.

1330
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,314
Pika.

1331
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,056
Phy!

1332
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:40,490
It can't be.

1333
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:41,993
No way.

1334
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,325
Pika.

1335
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:48,797
Mana!

1336
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:51,700
- You will be coming with me!
- Mana!

1337
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:53,306
Manaphy!

1338
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:57,343
As long as you're by my side,
I can always find the temple.

1339
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,587
Then I can take
what truly belongs to me.

1340
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:08,885
Huh?

1341
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:14,325
What's that?

1342
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:20,163
- Ash!
- Pikachu!

1343
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:25,996
Grr!

1344
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,340
Hey, Phantom!
I'm taking Manaphy back!

1345
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,241
You are?
Let's see you try.

1346
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,454
Corphish!

1347
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,388
- Hey, it's Ash!
- But how?

1348
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:48,086
Whosoever shall wear this crown

1349
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,789
shall be known
as King of the Sea.

1350
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:00,669
And it's true.
Behold the Sea Crown.

1351
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:03,174
It is the touchstone
between the People of the Water

1352
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,074
and the water Pokémon.

1353
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,084
Where are you going?

1354
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,867
Hmm?

1355
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,016
Aah!

1356
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,141
I got you!

1357
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,380
Why, you... Aah!

1358
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:51,855
Mana! Mana!

1359
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,395
- Ash got Manaphy.
- Pikachu!

1360
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:04,868
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

1361
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:10,939
Ahh!

1362
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:26,850
It's the Wailord.

1363
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,963
They're doomed.
Crush them all!

1364
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:32,031
Yes, sir.
Supersonic away!

1365
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,975
The Pokémon are
all in a confused state.

1366
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:00,087
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1367
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:01,125
Pika.

1368
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:05,528
Very soon I shall be known
as King of the Sea!

1369
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:09,162
- Mana!
- Huh?

1370
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:13,596
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh.

1371
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:17,969
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh.

1372
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,339
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh.

1373
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:27,115
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh

1374
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,692
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh.

1375
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,088
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh ooh-ooh

1376
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:43,068
Manaphy's singing
calmed them all right down!

1377
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:46,002
The way only Manaphy knows how.

1378
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,903
Mana!

1379
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:58,541
Ow! Ow!

1380
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:12,688
We've lost power!

1381
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,097
Sir, I'm afraid
we're sailing blind.

1382
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:17,295
Why, you cursed Pokémon.

1383
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,200
Huh?

1384
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,483
Mana!

1385
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:49,266
There are two types of men
in this world...

1386
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:53,464
those who are completely crushed
and those who do the crushing.

1387
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:58,140
What's he wearing?
A mecha suit?

1388
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:01,180
Wow. I didn't think a guy
like that took vitamins.

1389
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:03,510
- Vitamins!
- Pika.

1390
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:06,585
I'm not the type to be crushed.

1391
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,120
Nope.
Not me.

1392
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:10,951
Bleh!

1393
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:15,619
Phy!

1394
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:27,799
Manaphy!

1395
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:31,070
Manaphy!
Phy!

1396
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:32,736
Pikachu.

1397
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,768
Oh, so that's the Sea Crown.

1398
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:09,773
Sea Crown!

1399
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:14,379
Bleh.

1400
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:29,419
- Pika.
- And Manaphy's going, too.

1401
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:31,428
Hope we meet again.

1402
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:33,192
I'm sure you will, Max.

1403
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,199
Me too.

1404
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:38,794
This is Jack Walker.
Mission complete.

1405
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:41,032
Nice work, Jackie.

1406
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,620
Bye.

1407
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:03,330
Mana!

1408
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:09,362
Mana! Mana!

1409
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:10,435
Manaphy!

1410
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,609
Manaphy!

1411
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:29,281
I'm so proud of you
and all that you've done.

1412
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:30,480
Mana!

1413
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:33,683
You won't forget me, will you?

1414
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:41,734
Love you, May.

1415
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:42,928
Goodbye.

1416
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,002
Love you.

1417
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:46,766
Love you, Mama.

1418
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:49,171
Love you, May.

1419
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:54,510
Eeee!

1420
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:56,411
Mana! Mana!

1421
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:19,305
I'm gonna miss Manaphy.

1422
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,135
Yeah.
- Pika.

1423
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,869
May, are you all right?

1424
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:26,673
No, I'm not all right.

1425
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:30,173
But I will be.

1426
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:19,422
# In our never-ending journey #

1427
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,000
# The road has split apart #

1428
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:26,197
# A chapter wrote
as in the story #

1429
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,808
# A finish to a start #

1430
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:35,609
# And even though it feels like
the end, my friend #

1431
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:41,051
# You know
it's only the beginning #

1432
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:43,622
# It's the beginning #

1433
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:46,851
# Together,
we'll make a promise #

1434
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:50,361
# To never forget it all #

1435
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:53,523
# We've only scratched
the surface #

1436
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:57,125
# Of worlds we'll come to know #

1437
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,900
# Together, moving forward #

1438
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:03,601
# Even though we're far apart #

1439
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:07,305
# So safe and sound
inside our hearts #

1440
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:15,877
# We keep our word until
we are together once again #

1441
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:27,891
# And did you hear me
in a raindrop? #

1442
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:30,663
# I'm not that far away #

1443
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:34,900
# You can see,
in your reflection #

1444
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:37,772
# Another side of me #

1445
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:44,407
# And even though
we say goodbye, goodbye #

1446
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:49,181
# We will never be alone #

1447
01:43:49,356 --> 01:43:52,052
# No, we're not alone #

1448
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:55,821
# Together,
we'll make a promise #

1449
01:43:55,963 --> 01:43:58,864
# To never forget it all #

1450
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:01,934
# We've only scratched
the surface #

1451
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:05,766
# Of worlds we'll come to know #

1452
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:09,342

1453
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:12,070

1454
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:16,080

1455
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:23,622
# We keep our word until
we are together once again #

1456
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:29,723
# So goodbye to you #

1457
01:44:29,863 --> 01:44:33,162
# And everything
we went through #

1458
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,269
# We made it to the ending #

1459
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:39,304
# And the other side
of the Moon #

1460
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:43,000
# Goodbye to you #

1461
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:50,515
# We'll hold on to the memories
of the good times #

1462
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:54,051
# Together,
we'll make a promise #

1463

1464

1466
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:07,659

1467
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,702
# Even though we're far apart #

1468
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:15,206
# So safe and sound
inside our hearts #

1469
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:17,742
# It's all inside our hearts #

1470

we'll make a promise #
